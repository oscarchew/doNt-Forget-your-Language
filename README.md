The official repository of our EACL2024-Findings paper: Understanding and Mitigating Spurious Correlations in Text Classification with Neighborhood Analysis.
* üéØ Text classification models are prone to over reliance on spurious correlations that exist in the training set but may not hold true in general circumstances.
* ‚úÖ We demystify this underlying representation space and propose a simple yet effective mitigation method, NFL.
* üìù https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-eacl.68/
* üôå This project is a collaborative effort between National Taiwan University (NTU), University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

Installation
---
Assuming Miniconda is installed, run the following commands to set up the environment:
```bash
conda create -n nfl python=3.8
conda activate nfl
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
---
**Data**: The processed datasets are available at `data`. If you wish to create those biased/unbiased/filtered subsets for your custom datasets, please refer to `src/create_subsets.py`

**Models**: To reproduce the numbers in the paper, simply run `src/nfl.py` for NFL or `src/dfr.py` for the DFR baseline that we re-implemented.
