Yes there are actually a rare legitimate reason, but for the most part, everything I've read and seen shows the wrongful stealing outweighs the legitimate asset forfeiture.

"Obama faked higher ""deportation"" numbers by channeling expedited removals near the border into the deportation channel. But illegal entries are down by, iirc, 70% under Trump.

I am a supporter of the CMHC concept but it seems logical to make sure that the lender will always be required to share in a least a portion of the risk.

It's not just a contest of zero sum winners and losers like sports. It's not ""chaos"". New Zealand and many other nations have a working system.  When you have a democracy where two thirds of the population's views are not being heard (like Harper and Trudeau)or discussed or debated you have a pretty pathetic idea of democracy.  It's a joke. No wonder people get cycnical and bitch and moan .. it's because the current system keeps putting people who don't represent most of them in power.. that's a major problem. When people lose faith in democracy you get Trumps.",1

I'm not fine with the individual mandate - aka forcing millennials to pay for the insurance of baby boomers.

I can tell you that living on $45K in many metro areas doesn't go very far even before being required by law to purchase a $500+ product each month.  And the kicker is that the premiums are so high that most millennials will end up paying any healthcare costs out of pocket anyways.,0

And rational person see the problem with this?

$10 billion worth of oil is stolen by Big Oil per year.  Well over $45 billion over the last four years. The raid on the dividend program passed by those in the Senate who voted to pay to have our oil removed does not include inflation proofing- which means the dividend program would go away- and not even be available to fund state government in the future, if absolutely necessary.

 I know my dividends will pay me X amount every quarter, so it allows me to stay calm and not panic sell. Last Wednesday's drop was not even significant in historical context, so it sure helps having quality stocks that pay a dividend to stay the course.",0

This would have began with legislation, introduced by either Chretien, Martin, Harper or Trudeau, that clearly exempted a citizen like Khadr, from benefiting from the rights and freedoms our Charter provides, resulting from occurrences following clear evidence of taking action against our country and its allies.  He and his father were part of the Taliban and in Afghanistan.   The government could have continued to fight this battle in court rather than negotiate a settlement under such legislation.  We would extend perhaps a gesture of good will, as he is still a citizen, and treat him fairly and not as harshly as an adult, as he was still two years away from full adulthood.",0

"The Bible is not history. It is more a book of faith, beliefs, myths, metaphors, and rules. The Gospels were written 30-70 years after Jesus died. Each author presented their story from their point of view. 
Since Mark's was the first, it is probably the most accurate. No accounts of Jesus' birth or resurrection were included. It ends with the discovery of an empty tomb and the witnesses running off telling no one. Did the other authors add the missing parts or create them? Some Bibles have additional verses added to end of Mark to conform with Mathew and Luke's resurrection story. 
I prefer to look at the Bible at the thematic, symbolic, and metaphoric levels, than at the literal level.",0

"I say this as a senior, but another source of income seniors have -- which the young generations do not have -- is the ""imputed income on owner-occupied housing"".

Essentially home costs for seniors are low, once the mortgage is paid off.

This means that if you back into a tight spot you may not be able to get out by driving forward, especially if a large vehicle such as a pickup truck parks directly across from you after you park.  You are always safer to drive in and then back out as you will probably be able to back out no matter what.

There is some danger involved in driving hack, so I don't consider the tip to be excessive.  I've only recently started using taxi's to get back and forth to the airport, and I don't usually use taxis for transportation otherwise. When I do, the vehicle is typically quite worn out.

The outspoken, high profile, alt-right Breitbart editor, a frequent supplier of racist and sexist rhetoric, has been banned from the high mass of American conservatism, the Conservative Political Action Conference, and simultaneously dumped by his book publisher for comments endorsing adults having sex with young children.

One reason government has been unsuccessful in resolving homelessness (and its related issues) is because it doesn't want to appear ""insensitive."" So it allows people to consistently break the law. It also lets people camp and monopolize areas, which then become unsanitary and unsafe. Often in life, doing the nice thing and not the right thing leads to greater, unintended consequences.

In addition, when government does take the ""insensitive"" approach (which to the majority is sometimes needed) some people will deliberately mischaracterize its' actions for their own political purpose. Not so much to help the homeless or clean up the neighborhood but to feel relevant in promoting their own cause or ""dislike of government.""",0

<<The Trump administration wants to revamp and rename a U.S. government program designed to counter all violent ideologies so that it focuses solely on Islamist extremism, five people briefed on the matter told Reuters.

"Reuters says “The Federal Reserve has a 2-per-cent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.8 per cent.” This is misleading given the context, since previously the discussion has centred on the March update for the US CPI; the US personal consumption expenditure price index (PCEPI), which the US Fed targets, is still only available up to February. Its February annual inflation rate was 2.1%, up from 1.9% in January. So it is running slightly above target. The statistic Reuters refers to would seem to be the PCEPILFE, i.e. the PCEPI excluding food and energy, which had an inflation rate of 1.8% in February, the same as in January. However, the US Fed targets the PCEPI, not the PCEPILFE.",0

"Actually most people don't react at the time of an incident. 

It is more of a learned behavior to fight back. Only about 10% of the population does this. And fighting back is more of an adult male behavior. Soldiers, police officers, etc. receive extensive training to prompt them to respond in situations. You are more at risk of injury if you fight back and self preservation is a innate survival function. 

The natural instinct is either to do nothing or to flee. We tend to process unexpected changes after the fact over time.

Our legal system assumes you fight back or flee. So it does not accurately reflect all of our responses to a given situation.",0

Republicans lost their healthcare credibility decades ago when they voted against establishing Medicaid and Medicare.  Now decades later they're trying to convince voters to trust them as they continue spreading their cancer-like healthcare legislation down party members throat.

Voters need to start forming state-by-state campaigns against funding federal elected officials' Cadillac healthcare.  No discrimination when it comes to national healthcare.,0

China's government is still a dictatorship and compared to the US, China still lacks the basic legal framework and intellectual property laws that make the US the world's economic leader.  China's government sets trade agreements strictly for China's benefit and weak intellectual property laws give little protection to foreign companies.  Everything is done on China's terms.  China's government also competes unfairly through state-owned companies.

Countries do business with China because of China's huge population, not because China is great place to do business. The fact is, most countries don't trust China's government on trade and China will not be a leader until they modernize their laws and approach.",0

"The 406 mHz EPIRBs are completely satellite-based and NOAA, upon receiving a position, notify the nearest Coast Guard Sector (or other nation's rescue service).  The old 121.5 mHz EPIRBs were essentially radios that broadcast a distress signal.  If they had an old-style EPIRB, they're correct - only a nearby vessel would pick up the signal.  Satellites pick up the signals on the new-style units and while it takes some time to determine the specific position of the EPIRB, the info is accurate to within 2-5 NM.

Trump finally commented by releasing a one sentence statement through an off-camera briefing read by Sarah Huckabee Sanders to the press in which he praised his son's ""transparency.""

Sanders read, ""My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency.”

That was it.

Donald Jr. only released the email chain after knowing the NY Times was about to publish them so that's not the definition of being transparent.

That's called ""trying to control the narrative"" before damaging information is revealed by the press.

How does 'EVERY taxpayer' subsidize a political donation tax credit?

Especially when the current government runs deliberate bloated deficits during relatively steady economic times, there is a complex relationship between the responsibility of current and future taxpayers in relation to government tax revenues, and the very question of who owns the benefit of a tax deduction or tax credit plays into the analysis.  

For example, it is only when government spends too much that tax deductions or credits can be seen as a loss for the government that someone needs to subsidize.  Why is that assumption of overspending so deeply imbedded in Liberal analysis?",0

"A President of the United States who loves Russia and hates his own country.  The slip of the traitorous tongue shows his true allegiance to all things German, Fascist, and Totalitarian from the 1930s game plan for power.  Impeach now!",0
"You seriously think that undermining the rule of law is ""brilliant""?",0
You're a troll. You're not 907AK.,1
Dream on !    Mr. Trump is a narcissist and listens to no-one .  He wants to stir everything up in the White House so that he won't be investigated and he loves all the attention he is getting- just like Toronto's former mayor Rob Ford .  Nothing good will be accomplished as long as he is president .  God help the stupid Americans.,1
"Ritz crackers. They go together.
Pathetic that the conservatives' position on climate change boils down to junior high school name-calling. Get off the pot, Scheer. There's nothing more useless than a dirty Denier.",1
Supernova's hatred is pretty pathetic and funny.  Even hyper political partisans can't make that argument with a straight face.,1
Insatiable greed :(,0
"j4u:
I suggest you look up 'literally' in a dictionary.
Burqa? - you don't yet know the difference between burka and niqab?
Yup, I'm a Liberal supporter - and you're a cpc supporter - so what?
And lastly - what the heck does your response have to do with my post???",1
Conservatives cheating? I'm shocked.,0
"OK, let's take another approach for those who are willing to give the bishops more rope. This diocese is the 15th entity in the US to file for bankruptcy protection. . .is there another organization on this planet, except the RCC, that would accept this pattern of corporate behavior? Why hasn't the Vatican ""kicked ass and taken names""? (sometimes the vernacular works!).",1
I hope when Kealoha looses he has to pay city for lawyers cost.,0
"The corrupt, dying MSM just keeps doubling down on lies in its effort to install corporate rule under the veneer of democracy.  

Trump never uttered a word of support for extremists in Charlottesville.  Not a single word.  All he actually did was to be inclusive in condemning all participants in violence.  This sent the Military-Industrial-SJWs into a frenzy -- their impunity is supposed to be unchallenged, apparently.",1
Says you and your crystal ball.  :-),0
"Trump is SUCH a hypocrite. He reminds me of Frank Murkowski, who was an arrogant SOB when he ran for governor and an arrogant SOB as governor (much to the idiotic surprise of many who voted for him).  As a result many of his supporters suffered from buyer' s remorse. I have no doubt the same will happen with Trump--in spades, considering his record--if he is disastrously elected. I shudder to think.",1
Only bigger cowards are the Uncle Tom supporters and Hillary's bag lady cabal of parked broomsticks.,1
"Looks like Harper was right, Trudeau just isn't up to the job.",0
"I have long wanted a ""none of the above"" option.   It's especially irksome when the pollsters call and try to force you to choose one of their options.   You can see the manipulation from miles away.",0
"The other states seem to not have a problem; but wait, this is Hawaii.",0
Colorado Springs is the headquarters of Focus on the family. There's also a large klan presence there. My guess is that they're teaching their community to focus the wrong way. They've become a cult and a political pac in recent years. Some of their members are extremists and many are bullies who go on morality witch hunts. They make everyone they talk to crazy. They're trying to ban all drugs but I think a vaccine needs to be developed to cure their insanity.,1
"you eco nuts do get excited when people disagree with you.
but it's amusing.",0
"Wow, private school education (without vouchers ;-) ) and he still can't spell.",0
"Trump was elected by the average Joe & Jane who are fed up with living paycheck to paycheck for 20 plus years. If they end up paying more for insurance, health care or anything else he won't get a second term. They will stay home for the next election.",0
"No ways - perhaps to appeal and have that thrown out of court as well, at even more cost to the taxpayer. These 'police' clowns (I put it in quotes because they're anything but police) need to be stopped. But then in the Zupta Police State, we assume they won't be.",1
Nor are there any statues dedicated to slaves in Canada.,0
CNN is irrelevant. Who cares that another loser bites the dust.,1
"40-20: You make a good point. Would you support taking  5th graders to a KKK meeting? 
I don't think these kids are taken to liberal events. They watch TV, read the newspaper and read these notes. They get a good feel from how each ""side"" positions itself by the civility of the comments. Uncivil comments with no evidence provides a free lesson.",0
"“Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S.,” Trump tweets

No Comrade trump, they are laughing at you.",0
"There aren't any open positions right now for ""Comic fact checker"" or ""Comic synopsis writer"" though. 

I do have a deep knowledge of the comics because for some reason, my kids like to play ""quiz show"" about the comics where a snippet of dialogue is provided and you have to say which comic it is and the joke. Can't say it is all that fun, but it makes me approach the comics like I'm studying for the Calculus final.",0
The best advice is to do the opposire of what hypocrit Gore suggests.,1
"One child messed up badly, the second seems to be on a similar path. What's missing here is an understanding of what's up with the parent(s)…",0
It was a culture of drunken violence and neglect the white man was trying to save the kids from. Still do.,1
Tom McMillan should follow Obama's advice: lace up his shoes and run (for the CPC leadership).,0
"Some on the left are not pathological and/or hysterical all of the time. Moments of clarity still occur for them. All we really need are reasonable and realistic liberals, who what legislation to show consideration for those who live under those laws. Conservatives can work with legislators like that, and share a lot in common with them.
The Left though, have only their own 'control' issues in mind, and to hell with right/wrong, the law and everything else.",0
"Kinda like when we got Bin Laden when Obama was Commander in Chief.  Tactically perfect, except for the loss of the Blackhawk.",0
Garden troll Jeff sessions said he thought the KKK were good people until he found out some of them smoke pot. Sessions is a certified racist bigot who supports white supremacists but not the ones that use cannabis. It's absolutely clear that cannabis is far safer than alcoholic beverages or tobacco products which points to the fact that sessions is just another corrupt Nazi in the Trump Administration.,1
I wonder how much violence and anarchy resulted from those business loans?,0
It was a really lame site.,0
Actually it calls for the death of all Jews in the world.,1
Calling their parents evil and manipulative? I'm flagging this trash talk. Have you no decency?,1

"No, it doesn't mean a safer America. But on the bright side you're a Racist! Congratulations, Jim Bob!",1
"""How is little Chad and Becky going to have any fun if they can't do black face or dress up as an Indian ..."" Hey!  I dressed as Tonto one Halloween.  A real show or respect!  Oh, wait.  It's ""appropriation"" now. So much for respect, eh?  

Maybe I should have gone as the Masked Man himself, who believed, (among other things) "" That men should live by the rule of what is best for the greatest number."" (Lone Ranger Creed.)

Take that, special interest groups!",1
"Sorry Jim...it does not exist in Maui or anyplace else.  The problem here is that the incumbent was incompetent when he was on the Council, was voted out of the Mayor's office because he was arrogant and incompetent and voted back in because the person who succeeded him was even more arrogant and incompetent.  Hence, the need for a professional manager.  Not a pretty thought, though:  ""Who you gonna call?"".  

Democracy sucks when the voters base their votes on name recognition and emotion as they seem to in Maui.",1
"Looks like Miller's next, and then there won't be any of the team that was gonna Make America Great Again. This is ridiculous. 

Trump, you've shucked or lost the good people in favor of the swamp rats. You've lost the GOP and the Communist Party has always loathed you. Your family is more comfortable with the Commies than with MAGA.

You don't have the guts I thought you had. You're still better than The Crook but you sure have let me down.",1
"If this is a party that you are proud of, then may you sink with its metaphorical ship, fully committed.",0
"Real estate Commissions going down same way as Stock market transactions did in the 90's.. Remember how much you had to pay to buy or sell 10 shares? You probably dont, but it was about $50, then Came Datek and Ameritrade wand it went down to $9.99 then to $1 and now its free! Same thing will happen and is happening to real estate commissions! Los Angeles based discount broker offers 1% listing commission, check it out - http://itz-sold.com been offering 1 % listing commission for years, the rest of the industry just playing catch up game!",0
"Funny that Marcus Gee, a typical WASP would call out other WASPS on not doing anything.

It's what WASPs do - they do nothing, fight, are sanctimonious just like Gee is.

No wonder the Americans wanted their own country - they would turn into colonists like the people in Toronto and all their sanctimonious nonsense.",1
"Although Ms. Handel's margin of victory was far from overwhelming, it does send a powerful message to Democrats that they now need to move beyond the 2016 presidential election debacle. Simply spending money to defeat your opponent isn't a strategy. There needs to be a focus on new ideas and policies that resonate with the public and energize the progressive base of their party. The future of both national parties depends on making a solid case for the relevance of their goals to their constituencies. Always looking in the rear view mirror can often lead to an abrupt end to your journey.",0
Yep. White male supremacy is the nitty gritty of it all.,0
"How can we afford to cover dental care, we need millions of dollars to pay to treasonous terrorist teens.",1
RIP.  I do not believe he should  have been singled out for the dam issue. There were many circumstances that contributed to it. He was an easy scapegoat.,0
"Zzzzzzzz.............

Sorry...must have nodded of there.Can't absorb the passion here...possibly its feeling a bit forced.
Meanwhile any chance of a chess update ?",0
"Justin, Justin:
Please don't take us for fools. Leadership is standing for what is right, not simply what is opportune.

When you are looking in the mirror, it wasn't your smile that got you elected but hope for a principled approach to governance. 
Hold your ministers accountable, hold yourself accountable.

"Blind allegiance you have, Black.",1
"I know this article is more about getting people to buy a ticket to this event, but, it is difficult to think that either Obamas would have anything else to say that is relevant after 8 years of commenting on everything and doing practically nothing. A couple of examples, Michele's lunch program and Barack's utter lack 

Secondly, parents are responsible for their children's education, not the education industry. The worse thing we could do is turn any more power to nameless bureaucrats, whose only concern is to ensure they hang around long enough to collect their pension. We need tools to give the power back to parents such as school vouchers (just one example).",0
"AND he bit her face! what a creep, what a sick evil creep",1
"Outsider77, why would you say such a silly thing?",1
"""Millions of Trump supporters - many armed - will take to the streets...""

...because Democrats don't own guns?
...because only ""Trump supporters"" are violent?
...because the horrifying epidemic of gun violence is entirely Republicans' fault?",0
Depends on your perspective.  I'd suggest the vast majority of people in East Ukraine feel they were 'invaded' by their own government when the 'ATO' and thugs were sent to break up protests and subject the population to an undemocratic rule that they did not have a say in.,0
but the thing is - the govt isn't going to solve the problem.  no matter how much money they throw at it. We the people need to stop thinking any govt will solve any problems and do it ourselves.,0

"It's not that I'm an apologist for the monopolistic fraternity of overpaid bean counters, but I think the question posed in your headline is absurd on its face. 

What does passing the right envelope to a couple of equally overpaid actors to the sounds of a drum roll got to do with interpreting archaic tax rules or making sure obscene corporate profits have been calculated in accordance with GAAP?",0
"The fact that a large number of Americans don't give a damn that one of our worst enemies, the Russians, interfered with our election clearly demonstrates how amazingly stupid we have become. Unfortunately, Russia, the Chinese, and every other country in the world knows it. Europe is freaking out because their strongest ally has devolved into idiocy. Many European countries are close behind and considering electing right-wing numbnuts to ""lead"" their country. I am far more afraid of the fact that our president is in the pocket of Putin than I am of his other stands on issues - except perhaps his dislike and distrust of science.",1
"What better way to do a little kitty grabbing?
The ladies are lining up to to be groped. Believe me.",1
"Is anyone else tired of these articles about American politics? We get it, their leaders are idiots. 
There is whole world out there with interesting things going on. Perhaps the Globe could report on some of those events.",1
what do you do for a living? Its clearly not tied to trade.,0
"The Flames want free transit to their games for all ticket holders. Contrast that with: No free transit for those going to work. No free transit for those going to school. No free transit for those going to the hospital. No free transit for those going home after a night of one to many. 
As outlandish as that ask is, the Flames also want all revenue from the parking, including unrelated events, like The Stampede. 

The Flames, being the incredibly astute business people they are, should simply buy a piece of land( subject to successful permitting etc), build the facility, and go into business. Any conservative ought to understand that!",0
Get over yourself. You live in the most gun-friendly state in the Union. Figure out how to solve your problem without involving 80 million law-abiding citizens.,0

"I voted against a man for his belief and practice in white supremacy. 
Heil Trump",0
"My bottom line is I won't vote for ANY party who support use of aggression and violence to achieve an end.  Both Repubs and Dems do exactly that in the middle east and use that same approach globally.  Sorry, I can't live with approving murder.  I'm willing to give up the tidbits either party throws at us at home.  It's called sacrificing for your fellow man, and I'm talking about human lives.  I don't care whether I get a tax break or not or whether I'm paying into one garbage health system or another...I can't kill. 

And the whole concept that everyone is a threat is selfish paranoia.  The last time we had a true threat was is the late 1930's/early 1940's.",0
"On a similar thought, recently, an incident occurred in a southern California National Forest. Forest law enforcement were alerted to two men on an illegal ATV with a suspicious firearm. When LE arrived, the firearm had zero identification numbers and was confiscated as well as the men being detained. When asked of their immigration status, one chimed, ""You can't ask that in California."" The LE replied, ""We are federal employees and you're on federal land."" That status was determined to be illegal and back to Mexico they went minus their truck, ATV and gun. MAGA!",0
"Yeah, but Goodale won't let them ask any questions that might offend Muslim sensibilities.",0
"I've already started by calling Coffman every day, noting that if the bully-in-chief goads North Korea into killing innocent people, the blood is on the GOP's hands. I also call Gardner and Bennet warning them that SOMEONE needs to speak up loudly and clearly to stop this warmonger from shooting off his mouth, risking irretrievable actions by another unhinged leader.

I might add it's almost humorous that he jeopardizes world safety by offering a sniveling thank you to Putin for slapping America in the face. A tough-talking, ignorant coward in the WH thanks to a minority of right-wing extremists.",1
"You know nothing of these men's lives; you know more about Trump because he was never protected, groomed for politics the way Obama was.  I think the true Obama would astound you.",0
There is a point when it becomes a moral responsibility to starve the government monster of cash by any and all means.,1
You mean another chance to self promote ? Too late for that. Can we have our money back ?,0
"""Indeed, the more money that flows into housing, the less flows into stocks, bonds or banks.""

What a dumb statement. Money spent on home improvement goes to businesses and then banks. In many places, like Eugene, rent is the same as a mortgage. The writing is making the ASSumption that if you don't buy a house, you'll somehow automatically be flush with cash. If only the rental market reflected that naive optimism.",0

""But as famous as the Carter installation — and subsequent Reagan removal — was, it was George W.

The installation was done quietly, with far less fanfare than Carter’s, but the panels provided energy to several White House operations. ""  And that is from ThinkProgress.org

Found in many household and industrial products, endocrine disruptors are substances that ""interfere with the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones in the body that are responsible for development, behavior, fertility, and maintenance of homeostasis (normal cell metabolism).

They are sometimes also referred to as hormonally active agents, endocrine disrupting chemicals, or endocrine disrupting compounds.

"The Tolstoy paper that you referenced detailed a mechanism for, and the timing of tectonic activity influencing climate over very long (millennial) periods. That influence is not new knowledge. Tectonic activity has always been responsible for moving carbon from Earth to atmosphere. But this process is slow, and affects climate over very long durations. It is not responsible for current climate change. Underwater volcanoes do not effectively heat the ocean, and they emit only a tiny fraction of the CO₂ emitted by humans.

We know from mass balance accounting and isotopic analysis that the origin of the increase in the atmospheric mixing ratio of CO₂ is us. And it is that increase in CO₂ that has caused modern warming.

"Yes James, in fact that exact situation occurred today at my school. The teacher for one of the Fully Self Contained classrooms was absent and the EAs took the lead. I wish there were more opportunities for them to be compensated for their knowledge and work.",0

"Exactly. No trucks between Vail and Morrison westbound on Fridays between 5 and 10 or eastbound Sundays between 2 and 7. Simple solution, but it would take some cojones to resist transportation lobbyists. I'm also in favor of raising the gas tax, but that's not going to happen either.",0

"""Cities are diverse, cosmopolitan and liberal""

Mmmhmmm... Seoul, Tokyo, Beijing, Hong Kong, Kolkata, Shanghai, Karachi... pick names from a hat containing names of the worlds largest cities. And then tell me how many of those at the top, whether belonging to the ""Global North"" or South are liberal and diverse. Cosmopolitan? Maybe. But look at a list of large cities... Karachi, Dhaka, Seoul, Mumbai, Jakarta ... those are not liberal places.

Spare us the pie-in-the-sky articles, please.",0

"Finally some facts to understand what's going on. One thing that should be done is the federal government should normalize interest rates to around 5%. At a normal interest rates, most of the what to be speculators couldn't afford to buy into the market. A higher interest rate would also help our dollar. We could then add the foreign buyer tax, both would help normalize the market.",0

There is nothing hateful about wanting people to use the bathroom that suits the gender they were born with.  Quit making this about hate.  It has nothing what so ever to do with hate or dislike but I do not want a man in the bathroom with me.  I don't want grown men in the bathroom or locker rooms with my granddaughters either.  Have some common sense here.  Respect others right to privacy as well......,0
"Tough to reorganize this incredibly shallow pool of ""talent"".  

Dion needs to go entirely, his conduct on the sale of Justin's Jeeps to the Saudis was outright deceitful. Freeland has been nothing but an international embarrassment on every level and Monsef is an outright incompetent and likely committed fraud by keeping her true birth country secret.  

I suspect rookie Morneau will be on the block as well.  He turned a small surplus into a 19 billion deficit in one year for 2017. 

Have we seen ANY talent come out of this group?  Who do you replace these incompetents with?",0
"Taxes are necessary to pay for judges, national defense, & a very limited number of other explicit constitutionally enumerated functions.

"Question for developers: Why are there so few three-bedroom condo units? Do not compare a detached home with a 500 sf condo -- of course there is a mismatch there.
It is more difficult to plan and build a detached home than a condo unit. That's not surprising. I get that.
What I don't get is: Why is it more difficult to plan and build a three-bedroom 1900 sf condo unit than three tiny 500 sf condo units?",0

"Your toe-to-toe was on volunteer work, I think. I was talking about the information about public services for people, you know, referencing statements you've made such as: 'there's lots of that around', but then showing that you don't really know what it is and why. It seemed to me a good time to get ourselves on the same page or not, but I guess it isn't. For you anyhow. 


As to the rest of what you say, thank you so much for calling me out, if that's all you got out of any of it. Great talking to you again. A veritable font of rich, rationale conversation.",0
