The official repository of our EACL2024-Findings paper: Understanding and Mitigating Spurious Correlations in Text Classification with Neighborhood Analysis.
* üéØ **Problem** Text classification models are prone to over reliance on spurious correlations that exist in the training set but may not hold true in general circumstances.
* ‚úÖ **Solution** We demystify this underlying representation space and propose a simple yet effective mitigation method, do**N**'t **F**orget your **L**anguage (NFL).
* üìù **Paper** https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-eacl.68/
* üôå **Collaboration** This project is a collaborative effort between National Taiwan University (NTU), University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

Installation
---
Assuming Miniconda is installed, run the following commands to set up the environment:
```bash
conda create -n nfl python=3.8
conda activate nfl
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
---
**Data**: The processed datasets are available in the `data` directory. To create biased, unbiased, or filtered subsets for your custom datasets, refer to `src/create_subsets.py`.

**Models**: To reproduce the results in our paper, run `src/nfl.py` for NFL or `src/dfr.py` for the DFR baseline, which we re-implemented.
