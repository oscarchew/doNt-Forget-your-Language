"Sorry Bud, Conservatives have no lock on fiscally responsible policies, or supporters.
If most Conservatives are in the center socially, why do they wind up with people who oppose education, birth control, woman's rights,  and support banning clothing and propose snitch lines?
There are many fiscally conservative progressives and socialists, and until the Conservatives put the Progressive back in their name and platform, they're not going to vote for the Regressive Conservatives.",0
"I asked Fish & Game some time ago why it was not allowed for people who come across moose that has been killed by vehicles to take the meat. His answer, they are concerned that people would jump into their old beater pick-ups and flatbeds and start running them down, claim it was an accident and take the meat.",0
"No, what trump, the ignorant buffoon, is doing is demonstrating an inability to understand the english language.  The mayor of london was telling residents not to be alarmed at the presence of large numbers of police, not don't be alarmed by the attacks.  He called for calm, but trump, apparently, would prefer that people be hysterical.",1
"I agree my questions are indeed baited and a trap for people like you.  Let's take them one subject at a time.   You said you agree with affirmative action.   This is a program that lifts one race above another.   If it favored the white man over others, you would be screaming your head off.   That it favors others over the white man, does not make it any less racist.   If you therefore support this and similar programs, you must be racist.     The religious argument is similar in that you are favoring one religion over another.",1
"Seriously? Tax breaks for the wealthy, cut Medicaid, and most likely the loss of healthcare for 23 million people as stated in the previous House bill? How long can the clueless Trump supporters keep supporting this moron? He's the most unqualified person to ever step foot in the White House, yet the low-IQ crowd continues to support whatever idiotic policy he comes up with. Impeachment Day can't come soon enough and it will be declared a National Holiday!",1

"How ironic that you claim to support indigenous peoples, yet Jews lived in their homeland nation of Israel long before either the Roman Empire, or the later spread of Islam, both of whom conquered the region by use of extremely brutal military force..   
You are really quite the hypocrite, and clearly have a perverted view of history.",1
"Comrade, the panelists that presented their forecast are all accomplished economists. Economists live in the world of empirical evidence, and would not make these kinds of claims without considerable amount of data to back it up. The article likely doesn't get into the nitty-gritty details, because the details are tedious. While I was not in attendance for this event, I have in the past year heard Professor Tim Duy's presentations on economic forecast for Lane County twice. His claims are based on exhaustive and comprehensive research. His Data sources are diverse and reliable.
I understand the impulse towards skepticism, but ""these people,"" are experts in economics and I trust their ability to make conclusions based on empirical evidence.",0
"The DP has posted at least eight separate stories about this incident, and I'm sure there are more to come.
Last month when a Muslim black man in Fresno shot and killed three random white men on the street because he hates white people, the DP posted a grand total of three stories - and one of those was actually a story about gunfire sensors used by the police. 
I wonder why there's such a disparity in the amount of coverage.",0
"It's irresponsible to paint any group with such a broad brush because of the statement of a few ... I'm a moderate but I believe the issue isn't that ""all crime"" is committed by people here illegally but rather that ANY crimes at all are committed by those here illegally. Big difference.",0

"Proof? Just look at public records. Many cases of willful negligence the cause for many spills. Yes, many. Over 400 since 2003. KM has a history of having to taken to court to live up to their cleanup responsibilities.
I don't think most people are against jobs created, whether in BC or Alberta. Nor do they want to adversely affect people's livelihood. But the economic damage one oil spill would do to the fishing industry is also at risk.
There are other safer ways to transport oil, such as not going through coastal waterways.  It comes down to profit, and doing things where an oil spill would have less of an ecomonic impact are not in KM interests.",0
"We are all born with the freedom of choice.
For some it can be a blessing, and for other's it is a burden.

Where all the deport people at. This guy isn't hispanic or Muslim. Most likely a white Christian male and its crickets in here but if you listen to Trump band of can't think for themselves morons you would think crime is only done by Hispanic and Muslim people. This guy stole a lot of money. Still 2 million he has not paid back. So many wanted the guy who justbgot pardoned for the video store robbery to be in jail for life but this guy stole alot more dinero. They are such hippocrits,1
"After hearing Trump's speech in Eugene last Friday (and all the other bits from others around the country)-I am HORRIFIED that he is the Republican choice!  His speech was vacuous, self-obsessed, and he gave almost no information on what he would do if elected.  It was the worst political speech I have ever heard.  The fact that people think he is a valid candidate is as horrifying as Trump. This is a sad day to be a voter in the USA.  Sad and embarrassing. Bernie Sanders is a man of integrity, intelligence and wisdom.  He is something to work for and be proud of. Hillary Clinton is a ""business as usual"" puppet. The system is rigged and the entire planet suffers because of it.",1
"How come people forget about the costs of benefits? Do you think that they don't cost anything? Health insurance from day one is not cheap, saves employees an expenditure and 401(K) contributions. Also tuition assistance is great if employees take advantage of it. These things are not cheap and are part of monetary package to the employee, right?",0

"How did you get ""better"" out of ""not entirely bad news""???
Extremists and hard core partisans are going to remain that way.  They're the ones consuming most of the extreme fake news.  
It's the people that don't have their minds dead set on one extreme or the other (or just tend to be disinterested in general) that are more pliable.  Subtle bias is often worse for manipulating those people because they're more open to it and don't realize they're being manipulated as compared to a source that's pushing obvious bias. 
Most everyone else already has their mind made up.",0
"These Tax Cuts are NOT good for middle-class people of Hawaii. The plan is to ELIMINATE the DEDUCTION for STATE TAXES. I don't know about you, but I as a middle-class worker pay lots of State Taxes, so this will hurt me and the majority of middle class people in Hawaii.  Or at best, it will be a ""wash"".  Seems like the real beneficiaries are the ultra-wealthy via elimination of estate taxes.",0

"I don't believe their intent was traitorous to our liberal democracy, nor were these leaks credibly conceived to help some enemy more than they would aid us, The People. Some of the things that came to light such as ""Collateral Murder"" had been wrongfully covered-up. Then there was the ""Guantanamo Bay files leak"" in which ""...documents note that more than 150 innocent Afghans and Pakistanis, including farmers, chefs, and drivers, were held for years without charges."" Your outrage seems disingenuously targeted, not at the source of the problem, but at the source of light upon it. If you had your way, we'd all be in some sense enslaved to something very sordid indeed.",0

"absolutely, yes it is.  Have experienced it in my business.  Costs employers tens of thousands of dollars each time it happens.  The temp worker may be incredibly difficult to find, then cost a lot to train.  and then there are the histrionics when the temp worker has to leave as the new mom comes back. And why does government assume there is a nice supply of educated skilled people waiting to take a temp job??  I can tell you it is 20x easier to hire a person for a full time long term career position than for a mat leave temp job!",0
Are we serious here???  So now someone who is hungry who comes along to take the moose meat is stealing from the state of Alaska ?   Maybe it is somebody who was hungrier than you.   Honestly if you are collecting the meat to feed people and somebody came along that could use some of it and actually benefited from the tragedy of the accident then who are we to call them a thief ?   I think that we should be embarrassed that this article even exists.   I'm embarrassed for us !,0

"Department of Health Director, Virginia Pressler  COMPREHEND this:  “Especially in East Hawaii, where basically the source of the problem is, most people are on rainwater catchment systems and a lot of people don’t treat the water properly,” said Susan Jarvi, a rat lungworm disease expert at the University of Hawaii at Hilo. “One of the problems is there aren’t any clear guidelines for homeowners or farmers using catchment water for agricultural purposes.”  Now, do something, Virginia Pressler!!

"What is this ""Gunmerica""? You sound as if you're trying to condemn all of us for exercising our 2nd Amendment rights because we have a small percentage of people abusing the 2nd and doing stupid things.

"Where do these ignorant people come from! He is clearly the WRONG man for the job. When they do not honor our constitution they should never be in a position in government. The very thing they swear to protect seems to mean only for those in government. Our government cannot protect we the people and we have every right to the 2nd amendment to do so for ourselves. He just admitted he does not believe in the 2nd amendment of our constitution.  The Texas massacre is the fault of the government for failure to apply the current law, which is appropriately there to prevent this mad man from buying a gun. When only the government has weapons we get WACO Texas. This man should not be confirmed.",1
"You do realize that Chambers of Commerce are powerful REPUBLICAN lobby. Right?  You do realize that those pushing these projects are REPUBLICAN, right? The people on GoNoCo are Republicans as well.

"Treat women like crap and you should have your life ruined...except they haven't had their lives ruined and, in fact, are playing for schools right now. We need to start creating a society and culture where men don't feel entitled to sex, women's bodies, or women's subservience. We could start with teaching boys and young men that, hey, shocking, women are people and not sexual objects that exist for your pleasure. We could start with teaching mutuality and equality; that gender is a societal construct unrelated to biological sex. The very least we could do is mandate that male athletes go through consent and anti-violence programs before they play. 
The other thing we could do is challenge pornography--what they did was right out of misogynistic porn.",1
"xqglfirp,  You hit the nail on the head.  I lived in an Arab country for over two years.  I found the Muslim people lovely to interact with on a day-in-day-out basis.  But an honest Muslim will tell you (and it's been told to me to my face) they will NOT report a terrorist family member to the authorities.  In other words, family loyalty comes before public safety.

"The Hawaiian alii were long despicable, double-dealing mean, and hateful among each other long before Capt Cook arrived.  And after, the recognized rulers, although well educated, were comparatively stupid alongside the foreigner.  But then, it was their land to fight over.  No outsider has any moral or good reason otherwise to take a native land away, despite reasoning that natives don't deserve their land, the stronger can take it, they sold it by principles of self-serving western laws, etc.  But of course, there exist many well sounding prose and dissertation over how a migrant people can come visit, then take over or otherwise come to legally possess and then take your home away...especially when a brother or two like stay with the migrant.",1
"He will never do it.  Trump is clearly a crook and a fraud.
He has sold the American people a bag of manure.   And it is really starting to stink badly now.

I've read at least four articles this week about police lying about why someone was shot. Luckily there was video to show their lies. Maybe if you read more less racist sites you would know this.

"The Donaldson bunt, ridiculous.  Who cares it was textbook, doesn't matter he legged it out, wouldn'ta mattered if he'd been thrown out if the runners advanced.  Wrong play.
He's considered your best hitter, he does not bunt there, he swings away, as he did his next AB, when he pounded out a 2-run shot.
If memory serves, and it do, Your Js counted 1 run in the inning Donaldson bunted, and 6 in the inning he homered, 2 of which came on his long ball.  Do the math, people.
How much longer does the manager continue with a so-obviously overmatched Bautista in the 4-hole?  This is goony birds managing.

A refundable tax credit in many cases gives money to people who have not paid any income tax.  A perfect example of that would be a single mother with 2 children who worked part time for minimum wage.  When she files her return, she claims head of household, takes herself and her two children and claims the EITC (Earned income TAX CREDIT)  The amount of money she will get back is MORE than she paid in.  It is a REFUNDABLE CREDIT ...

"Let's just say I'm okay with any kind of interaction that takes place between peopleas long as it hurts no one. The person asking has a motive--to get the help they need and the giver has a motive--getting the satisfaction of helping another human being. So there is gain in the situation for all concerned. Like most people who give money or goods to people who need it, I do not ""automatically"" give in every situation. Sometimes I have nothing but a smile or a nod to give. This could be on foot or in a car, it depends on the situation. For many people, giving to others is not such a mysterious process.",0

"Just what is it that the proponents of this initiative do in the restroom?

"The amount of bail is contingent upon perceived flight risk.  It was never the purpose or intent of bail to keep people locked up no matter what.  It's just a means to secure a defendant's return to court for trial - and judges usually have the discretion to deny bail if a defendant is unlikely to comply or poses a serious safety risk if released.  If we consider the two defendants mentioned in your comment, I think even a gut reaction will lead most lay people to conclude that someone accused of embezzling a substantial amount of money is the bigger flight risk than another defendant of far lesser means, hence the much higher bail amount for the former.",0
"Let me respond to ixtlan's comment regarding homelessness.
One reason government has been unsuccessful in resolving homelessness (and its related issues) is because it doesn't want to appear ""insensitive."" So it allows people to consistently break the law. It also lets people camp and monopolize areas, which then become unsanitary and unsafe. Often in life, doing the nice thing and not the right thing leads to greater, unintended consequences.
In addition, when government does take the ""insensitive"" approach (which to the majority is sometimes needed) some people will deliberately mischaracterize its' actions for their own political purpose. Not so much to help the homeless or clean up the neighborhood but to feel relevant in promoting their own cause or ""dislike of government.""",0
"My point exactly...CAPE ignores interest rates...as do you,Mr Bond.

But it has only been this high  three times before...2000,2007 and 1929.....

"The sheep metaphor was useful in Biblical times. Today, it has its limitations. Human beings are not mindless beasts. We give glory to our Creator through the use of our God-given intellects.
Besides, whenever people are referred to as sheep in Scripture, the point is that we are all under the care of the one Good Shepherd. Jesus told Peter to feed ""my"" sheep. He didn't say they would henceforth belong to Peter himself.
I have no problem with the notion of Jesus as my shepherd, but that relationship doesn't extend to clergy. I respect them as religious leaders and I take their authority seriously. But, no, I don't consider myself part of a flock to be herded.",0
